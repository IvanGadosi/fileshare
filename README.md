### About The Project
The purpose of this project is to let people share files over the internet. The files must
be smaller then 100MB and will be stored for the next 24 hours. After the user uploads a file, he will
recieve a unique file-key, that allows him to download the file. Recently used file-keys will be stored
inside sessions. If the user wishes to save the file permanently, he can do so by paying a small fee.
